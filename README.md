# Layermesh
*A library for manipulating 3D meshes as set operations on convex objects*


Layermesh allows you build complicated non-convex 3D meshes by combining convex
objects, and export the resultant mesh as an STL or TIFF file for 3D printing.

Layermesh is currently in development.
It is written in C++, and built on CGAL, the
[http://www.cgal.org/](Computational Geometry Algorithms Library,)
specifically on its
[http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/packages.html#PkgTriangulation3Summary](Triangulation
3D) module, which is licensed under GPLv3 (and therefore so is this project.)
